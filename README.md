# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

This repository contains the implementation for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship Assignment. The task involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on eCommerce transactions data to extract actionable business insights.

## Dataset Overview
The analysis uses three datasets:
1. **Customers.csv**: Contains customer information (ID, name, region, signup date).
2. **Products.csv**: Contains product information (ID, name, category, price).
3. **Transactions.csv**: Contains transaction details (ID, customer ID, product ID, date, quantity, total value, price).

## Task Objectives
1. Perform detailed EDA on the provided datasets.
2. Extract at least 5 actionable business insights from the analysis.
3. Present insights in a concise and meaningful manner.

## Contents of the Repository
- **eda_business_insights.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script for EDA, visualizations, and insights.
- **eda_business_insights.pdf**: PDF report summarizing the key business insights.
- **Customers.csv**, **Products.csv**, **Transactions.csv**: Sample datasets (or instructions to upload the datasets).

## Business Insights (Example)
1. Seasonal trends in customer signups.
2. Popular product categories and their sales contribution.
3. Regions with the highest sales volume.
4. High-performing products and customer purchase patterns.
5. Insights on high-value transactions and loyal customers.

# Lookalike Model for Customer Recommendations

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Lookalike Model that recommends the top 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model uses customer, product, and transaction data to compute similarity scores and generate recommendations.

## Project Objectives

Build a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers.
Use customer profiles and transaction history to calculate similarity scores.
Deliver the top 3 lookalikes for the first 20 customers (C0001 - C0020).

## Deliverables
Lookalike.csv: A file mapping each customer to their top 3 similar customers with similarity scores.
Python Script/Jupyter Notebook: A detailed implementation of the model, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, similarity calculation, and evaluation.

## Evaluation Metrics
Precision: Measures how many recommended customers are relevant.
Recall: Measures how many relevant customers were successfully recommended.

# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques

## Project Overview

This project performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques to group customers based on their transactional and profile data. The analysis helps in identifying customer behaviors, which can be used for targeted marketing strategies and improving customer engagement.

## Project Deliverables
Clustering Results:

Number of clusters: 4
DB Index: 0.63
Silhouette Score: 0.58
Jupyter Notebook:
Contains all steps from data preprocessing to clustering and evaluation.
Includes visualizations of the clusters.
Report:
Detailed report summarizing the clustering results, evaluation metrics, and insights.
